This is my personal CV, that I created using a free template from internet, which I modified and add some caracteristics that are intersting to me. The Software that I provide, as the software base have an MIT License.

If you also interesting in me as a professional for your projects feel free to contact me. The information are in the CV.

PS: This is probably an older version. I keep my original CV in Overleaf. From times to times I will re push it to GitHub, but not always.
